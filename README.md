The official React Native integration library for Stream, a web service for
building scalable newsfeeds and activity streams.

Note: The user interface for the activity feed can vary widely across different apps. Most of our activity feed customers integrate with Stream via their backend and build their own UI. This takes advantage of Stream’s scalability while keeping full control over the UI. This library is only updated and improved sporadically.

## TL;DR built-in components for social networks and regular apps

- Flat feeds
- Timelines and Newsfeeds
- Notification feed
- Likes
- Comments
- Activity detail view
- Realtime notifications

## 🔐 React Native Compatibility

To use this library you need to ensure you match up with the correct version of React Native you are using.

| `react-native-activity-feed` version | [`getstream`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/getstream) | react-native |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------ |
| `1.x.x`                              | `>= 0.6.x`                                             | `>= 0.60.0`  |
| `0.x.x`                              | `< 0.6.0`                                              | `< 0.60.0`   |

## 🛠 Installation

### Expo package

```sh
# For Expo apps
expo install expo-activity-feed expo-permissions expo-image-picker

```

### Native package

```sh
# For apps with native code
yarn add react-native-activity-feed react-native-image-crop-picker
npx pod-install
```

**Note** If you are planning to use the image picker functionality, there are some additional steps to be done.
You can find them here - https://github.com/ivpusic/react-native-image-crop-picker/blob/v0.25.0/README.md#post-install-steps

## 🔌 Usage & Activity Feed setup

### Setup StreamApp component

In order to use Stream React Components in your application, you first need to initialize the `StreamApp` component. `StreamApp` holds your application config and acts as a service/data provider.

```jsx
<StreamApp
  apiKey='{API_KEY}'
  appId='{APP_ID}'
  userId='{USER_ID}'
  token='{TOKEN}'
  analyticsToken='{ANALYTICS_TOKEN}'
>
  {/* everything from your application interacting with Stream should be nested here */}
</StreamApp>
```

1. **API_KEY** your Stream application API_KEY
2. **API_ID** your Stream application ID
3. **USER_ID** current user's ID
4. **TOKEN** the authentication token for current user
5. **ANALYTICS_TOKEN** [optional] the Analytics auth token

You can find your `API_KEY` and `APP_ID` on Stream's dashboard.

#### Generating user token

The authentication user token cannot be generated client-side (that would require sharing your API secret). You should provision a user token as part of the sign-up / login flow to your application from your backend.

```js
const client = stream.connect(API_KEY, API_SECRET);
const userToken = client.createUserToken(userId);
console.log(userToken);
```

#### Generating analytics token

React components have analytics instrumentation built-in, this simplifies the integration with Stream. In order to enable analytics tracking, you need to initialize `StreamApp` with a valid analytics token. You can generate this server-side as well.

```js
const client = stream.connect(API_KEY, API_SECRET);
const analyticsToken = client.getAnalyticsToken();
console.log(analyticsToken);
```
